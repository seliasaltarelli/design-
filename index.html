        <p class="p1">>German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn invented the side bar, horizontal bar, parallel bars, balancing beam, and jumping events in the late 1700s. He is regarded as the "father of modern gymnastics" more than anyone else. In the 1800s, gymnastics was a thriving sport in Germany. When Baron Pierre de Coubertin revived gymnastics, it was included in the programme of the first Olympic Games of our period in 1896. Canada competed at its first world-level FIG tournament in Melbourne in 1956 with just one male gymnast and one female gymnast  . The first male gymast Curtis Hibbert earned a silver medal on the high bar at the 1987 World Championships in Rotterdam, it became Canada's first-ever medal at a World Championships.</p>
